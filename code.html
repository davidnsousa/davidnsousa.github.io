Understanding the relation between dominance and spatial structure and its consequence on social behavior (with Netlogo applet).

**More about it:**

Dominance interactions between group-living animal species are related with control of resources such as food, safe spatial locations and sexual partners. Despotic and egalitarian societies (based on different dominance styles) can be found in nature (insects, birds and primates). While in the former, these benefits (due to priority of access to resources) are strongly biased towards most dominant individuals, in the later they are more equally distributed.

It is generally considered by observation and analysis of the social behavior of different macaque species, that differences between despotic and egalitarian societies are a consequence of differences in the co-evolution of related social dispositions, such as, intensity of aggression and degree of nepotism (Thierry, 1985 and 1990). Hemelrijk (1999) shows however that these differences in social behavior can also arise in the absence of nepotism, due only to different potentials of spatial self-structuring that depend on different intensities of aggression. Higher intensity of aggression promotes dominance differentiation and a steeper hierarchy, which leads to the emergent phenomenon of spatial centrality of dominants because less dominants flee to the periphery of the group but never too far since the group provides safety. This in turn affects group cohesiveness, decreases frequency of interactions and feeds back dominance differentiation. Dominance relations are thus self-reinforcing. A positive feedback loop system is established between spatial structure and hierarchy differentiation.

This model is inspired on the artificial life model of Hemelrijk, to simulate the complex system described. In this computational model of dominance and spatial structure, resources are not explicitly implemented but they are implicitly assumed as agents in a virtual world engage in competitive interactions whenever other agents are found in their personal space.

Agents can move in a toroidal virtual world (to avoid border effects) of size 51 x 51 spatial units. Their visual field is defined by an attentional angle (attentional-angle) and attentional-distance (maxview). The order in which agents act in the world is random, which is biologically plausible for small groups of agents as considered here by default. For much larger groups however a locally controlled activity sequence should also be implemented, in which agents act if they see any another agent acting in their visual field. Here to simplify, one time-step counts after all agents act in a random order.

Two opposing forces affect the group spatial structure: the agents are attracted to one another because being in the group provides safety, but aggregation implies competition for resources (individuals strive for higher ranks) which drives individuals apart. In this model, aggregation is defined by the grouping rules defined in Hemelrijk, C. K. (1999, January).

For more details see the model.

Experiments on the evolution and maintenance of cooperation in spatially structured populations (with Netlogo applet).

**More about it:**

Game theory has been extensively used to study cooperation and competition among individuals in social, political and economic contexts (eg: Nash, 1950).

In evolutionary biology, cooperation is based on reciprocal altruism. In terms of game theory: the relationship between two individuals repeatedly exposed to symmetrical reciprocal situations is exactly analogous to the Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) (Trivers, 1971).

An organism does not need a brain to employ a strategy, however, game-playing is more or less rich and complex depending on the cognitive abilities of the players involved. Independently of the complexity of the strategy that an organism employs, for a cooperative strategy to evolve and be maintained in populations where non-cooperators are also present, it must be robust, stable and initially viable (Axelrod & Hamilton, 1981).

Not all biological entities that exhibit cooperative interactions evidentiate cognitive abilities such as remembering past interactions, recognizing players or anticipating future encounters. Nowak and May proposed an approach which considers only two kinds of players: those who always cooperate and those who allways deffect. The players are placed in a two dimensional array of patches, each being cooperative or non-cooperative. Each round, every individual plays de PD with a fixed predefined number of immediate neighbors, and after that, each site in the lattice is occupied either by its original owner or by one of the neighbors, depending on who scores the highest total in that round. The authors have shown that for a wide range of values for the parameters that characterize the advantage of cheating, a simple and purely deterministic spatial version of the PD can generate self-organized spatial patterns that evolve more or less chaotically. (Nowak and May, 1992).

A more realistic assumption than copying the strategy of the best performing neighbor (deterministic update rule) is to allow for "probabilistic winning" (Nowak et al, 1994). But whether the update rule is deterministic or probabilistic, in general, cooperators and non-cooperators can persist for a wide range of values of the cheating advantage parameter. Spatial arrays promote the coexistence of strategies. In particular, cooperation can persist without any evidence of cognitive complexity. 

This model investigates the evolution and maintenance of cooperation in spatially structured populations. 

This model is based on Nowak and May (1992), Nowak et al. (1994) and the Netlogo model PD Basic Evolutionary Wilensky, U. (2002). Each round, every individual patch plays the prisoner's dilemma  with a fixed predefined number of immediate neighbors (8 or 4), and after that, each site in the lattice is occupied either by its original owner or by one of its neighbors. Deterministic and probabilistic update rules can be tested, as well as stochasticity m, and the cheating advantage b. The update is asynchronous. See the references for more details.

For more details see the model.
