My background is physics (Bachelor’s Degree) and Cognitive Sciences (Master’s Degree). I am an active contributor to the open source scientific software community and a member of the Primate Cognition Research Group. I have done research in Biophysics – water diffusion in biological tissues; Cognitive Science – the co-evolution of cooperation and social cognition in primates under ecological pressure; Social Psychology –  the effect of human odors  produced under positive and negative odors on the perceived presence of others in the immediate environment. I am essentially interested in embodied social cognition and ecology,  and currently, I am doing a master’s degree in Anthropology.

This website is dedicated to present my research interests, projects and research output.
